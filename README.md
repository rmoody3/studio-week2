# Welcome to the Studio Week 2!
### Date: 4/1/2020

This repo contains a small, 4 page website that contains a series of different base maps, each on it's own page, completed as an assignment for a Webmapping course at Clark University. You can preview the site by opening the index.html file in a web browser, or clicking the link below. The code used in this repo is a mix of html and css, and combines use of Leaflet and Mapbox maps.
